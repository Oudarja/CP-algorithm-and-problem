                        DEGREE AND RADIAN CONFUSION


x is always calculated as radian so when is necessary to use it as degree degree conversion is needed 
 
WE know
=>1 radian=(2/pi)*90 degree
=>1 radian =(180/pi)degree
=>1 degree= (pi/180) radian

In radian:
sin(x)
asin(x)
 
In degree:

sin((x*pi)/180.0
(asin(x)*180)/pi[Inv sin always give radian unit of angel so 180/pi has to be multiplied ]

                                    GRAPH THEORY
 
euler path : An Euler path is a path that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats.
             Being a path, it does not have to return to the starting vertex.
 
euler circuit: An Euler circuit is a circuit that uses every edge in a graph with no repeats.
               Being a circuit, it must start and end at the same vertex.
 
**In case of undirected graph if every node has even degree the graph has euler circuit
 
**In case of directed graph if every node's in and out degree is same then the graph has euler circuit
 
**In case of euler path if the graph has atleast 2 nodes with odd degree then the graph has euler path
 
In case of euler path in directed graph:
a) There should be a single vertex in graph which has (indegree+1==outdegree), lets call this vertex 'an'
b) There should be a single vertex in graph which has (indegree==outdegree+1), lets call this vertex 'bn'
c) Rest all vertices should have (indegree==outdegree)
   If either of the above condition fails Euler Path can't exist.

diameter of graph:  The diameter of graph is the maximum  shortest distance between the pair of vertices. 
                    Way to solve it is to find all the n shortest paths  between each node 
                    and then find the maximum of all.
 
diameter of Tree:  Same

 
                                          Number THEORY

**Every number that is not power of two can be expressed as a sum of consecutive integer

**proof:gcd(n,m)=gcd(n%m,m)

n=q*m+r, d = gcd(n,m) and e = gcd(r,m)
so, d | m and d | n so , d|(n-q*m)=> d|r 
so d|r and d|m so, d|gcd(r,m) => d|e
again e|m and e|r so, e|(q*m+r)=>e|n 
as e|m && e|n  so, e|gcd(n,m) => e|d
so d|e and e|d so, e=d => gcd(n,m)=gcd(n%m,m)
 
**proof: if n is coprime to m then n%m is also coprime to m

gcd(n,m)==gcd(n%m,m).....(i)
So n is coprime to m and gcd(n%m,m)=1 that means n%m is also coprime to m
So if n is coprime to m then n%m is also coprime to m
 
**proof: gcd(a,b)==gcd(a-b,b) or gcd(a+b,b)
  
d=gcd(a,b) so a=d*m1 and b=d*m2 ,so gcd(a,a-b)=gcd(d*m1,d*(m1-m2))=d=gcd(a,b)
same is for  gcd(a+b,b)
 
**Geometric random variable X=number of independent trials to get sucess where

Fermats little theorem:

   ***(a^(p-1)) ≡ 1( mod p)

    where p is a prime number and a is an integer
    [ 
      Fermat's little theorem states that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number 
      a^p – a is an integer multiple of p. a^p ≡ a (mod p)[As a^p - a = k*p then a^p= k*p + a , So (a^p % p = a ) 
    ]
  
    a^p ≡ a(mod p) 
  => a^(p-1)≡a*a^(-1)(mod p)
  => a^(p-1)≡1(mod p)

 ***  It is used when the exponent of some base is very big and it has tobe calculated modulo P where P is prime. 
 ***  Then exponent can be optimized through this theorem

Rotate a matrix 90 anti clockwise

Prove that every perfect square have odd number of divisor

soln:

      every number can be expressed as a prime factor and their multiplication 
so if n is a perfect square so n=k*k=k^2

now
 k=p^a*q^b*r^c...

 so n=k^2=p^(2*a)*q^(2*b)*r^(2*c).....

number of divisor of n is (2*a+1)*(2*b+1)*(2*c+1)

where 2*n+1=odd number for any real value of n 


so multilplication of 2 or more odd number results in odd number so every perfect square has odd number of divisor

if x1>=x3 and x2<x1 or vice versa case 
(i) is not true because |2*x1-(x2+x3)| acts as x1-x2+x1-x3 where if (x1<x3 and x1>=x2) then or (x1<x2 and x1>=x3) then result decreased but in

***very very basic***
what is the maximum multiple of m which is less or equal n?
sol:

    u=n/m;

    So, the maximum multiple of m which is less or equal to n is = m*u;
                                                                 = m*(n/m)

****one math matics****
what number will give the maximum value of F(x)
where, F(x)= x / m  + x mod m  ; x<=n
sol:

      The  maximum multiple of m which is
      less or equal to n is u=(n/m)*m;
      let,
      so the previous multiple of m which is just less than u is x
      x=(n/m)*m-m;

      The number which will maximize the value of function is x+m-1     
                                                              =(n/m)*m-m+m-1
                                                              =(n/m)*m-1

***Number of trailing zeroes in n!
sol:
  
   1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*11*12*13*14*15*16.........n
     ^   ^ * ^   ^    *^    ^     ^  *
   here every 2nd number is multiple of 5 and every 5th number is multiple of 5 so in any n! number of 5 will be less than number of 2
   as trailing zeroes is contributed by number of 10-->2*5 so it is better to find the number of 5 in any n!  

   formula to find this is : n/5+ n/(5*5) + n/(5*5*5) +........n/(5*5*..5) until n/(5*5*5...)>0
   
  complexity: log5(n)


***Zeckendorf's theorem:
=> Zeckendorf's theorem states that every positive integer can be represented uniquely as the sum of 
one or more distinct Fibonacci numbers in such a way that the sum does not include any two consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

***If any number is a sum of two consecutive fibonachi number than the number itself is a fibonaci number 

proof by induction:

 The first part of Zeckendorf's theorem (existence) can be proven by induction.
 For n = 1, 2, 3 it is clearly true (as these are Fibonacci numbers), for n = 4 
 we have 4 = 3 + 1. If n is a Fibonacci number then we're done. Else there exists j such that Fj < n < Fj + 1. 
 Now suppose each a < n has a Zeckendorf representation (induction hypothesis) and consider a = n − Fj .
 Since a < n, a has a Zeckendorf representation. At the same time, a < Fj + 1 − Fj = Fj − 1 , other wise if a > Fj-1 then a + Fj > Fj+1
 which indicates n > Fj + 1 but this is not true it has been assumed that Fj < n < Fj + 1   
 so the Zeckendorf representation of (a) does not contain Fj − 1 .That means no two consecutive Fibonacci number  
 As a result, n can be represented as the sum of Fj and the Zeckendorf representation of a .  
        
      
Is it possible to build a rhombus with every width and every height such that the vertices of the rhombus are in integer points?
=>>> No, it is possible only if the width and the height are both even.

***observationbal problem 
Given some sequence  of number in every step each number can be decreased but not same number can be decreased twice but alternatingly 
can be decreased 
example:
2
3 4
| |
0 1 
here number 0th number can be decreased first so the sequence will be 2 4 then again the 0th number can not be decreased 
so 1st number can be decreased so the sequence will be 2 3 
can all the number be made to 0??

ans:
  here 
    2 3   deleting 1 from   1st number  and 2nd number in 1st and 2nd step 
    1 2   deleting 1 from both 1st number  and 2nd number  in 3rd and 4th step
    0 1   deleting 1 from both 2nd number  and 1st number in 5th and 6th step
    0 0   deleting 1 from 2nd number in 7th step

 so it is clear that every number less than 1st maximum and 2nd maximum can be decreased but at last if 1st maximum and 2nd maximum 
 has difference greater than 1 than the answer is "NO" otherwise "YES";

 another example
   1 2 3 4 6
   0 1 2 3 5
   0 0 1 2 4
   0 0 0 1 3
   0 0 0 0 2

so as 6-4==2 that will be present after all operation so in this case answer is "NO";

Intersection algorithm:

there are intersection between a1 and i1 and a1 , i2 and a2 , i3 and a3 .....in and an

how to find the intersection??
